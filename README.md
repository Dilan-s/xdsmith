# XDsmith

XDsmith is a random testing framework for the Dafny toolchain. It uses [Xsmith](https://www.flux.utah.edu/project/xsmith) to generate Dafny programs that are suitable for random testing.

## Installation

We recommend that you use Docker to run XDsmith. Therefore, you will need to install Docker, either via the installer from the website or from your OSâ€™s software manager. After that, run `docker build -t test .` from the the project directory. Then, you should be able to run `docker run --entrypoint bash -it test` to start the XDsmith environment.
